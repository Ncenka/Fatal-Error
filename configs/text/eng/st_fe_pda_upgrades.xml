	<string id="pda_fix_screen_1">
		<text>My PDA screen is broken - can you replace it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_fix_screen_2">
		<text>What!? You can't break it! There's tempered glass in there, if you throw it against the wall, the brick will break! Okay, give it here... So... Well, the insides are intact, nothing serious, but replacing the screen will cost you 5,000 rubles! I can't imagine how you broke it!</text>

	<string id="pda_fix_screen_3">
		<text>Take the money for the screen. \n%c[d_orange][5,000 rubles]</text>

		<text>That's great, here you go, it's as good as new now.</text>

	<string id="pda_fix_screen_5">
		<text>It's too expensive... I'll probably come back about it later..</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_fix_screen_6">

	</string>
	<string id="pda_fix_1">
		<text>My PDA just don't work!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_fix_2">
		<text>Give it here... Yeah, I get it - it fried out, that happens sometimes, the voltage jumps - did you get caught by emission or hit by electra? Whatever the reason, I'll need to replace almost all the electrical components. Well, you're in trouble - you'll have to shell out at least 5,000 rubles and at max 40,000 rubles - depends on PDA model. And also, don't even ask me to fix anything other than regular stalker PDAs! There was a stalker once, he brought God knows what, some kind of ultra-modern PDA, a military model - i hate such models! They're so fancy that fixing them isn't worth a second of my time.</text>

		<text>That's great! Here you go, it should work like new now!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_fix_8">
		<text>Well, as you wish, but you won't last long without PDA... If you have extra money, come back.</text>
