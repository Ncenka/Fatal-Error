		<text>An industrial-grade military model of the GETAC PS535E PDA, originally used by military engineering units and reconnaissance personnel for field operations in harsh but predictable conditions, is built with a reinforced housing and a weather-resistant display. The manufacturer of the PDA is the Taiwanese company Mitac Technology Corporation, which has long specialized in the development and production of military-grade devices. PDA GETAC PS535E can intercepts cellular and network traffic of other PDAs in order to display precise location of stalkers. The device remains reliable under normal field exposure but proves totally unfit for the Zone's environment. Its power consumption is significantly higher than most other PDAs and it can only be recharged by an UPD. Technicians never repair this model due to its complexity - and, as a result, it cannot be upgraded in any way. Rarely seen around the Zone, typically used by military personnel, or occasionally supplied by high-ranking military officials and covert operatives.\n \n

		<text>An extremely rare and unique model of the Kulon PDA, which can only be obtained on the Mainland. This model is ideal for the harsh conditions of the Zone - the PDA is made of a metal case with full electromagnetic shielding and total protection from moisture and dust, which is why its breakage is possible only in theory, and the touchscreen display is made of triplex glass, which makes it impossible to damage it, and is also covered with a special weatherproof film on which among other things, there are no traces and scratches. This model also has extremely low energy consumption, which allows it to run for up to a week on a single pair of batteries. All ports for communication with the outside world (USB, PCMCIA slot, memory card ports) are covered with special plugs, and the main focus in communication with the outside world is on wireless communication - for this purpose, a special encryption key is used that cannot be hacked and thanks to which the PDA cannot be detected - however, this entails the main disadvantage of this PDA, which is that unlike the Model 2.0 and Model 3.1 PDAs, the Kulon PDA cannot rely on encryption key sets, thereby it cannot gain direct access to network-connected devices to receive data, but, it can intercept and redirect other special encryption keys, and as a result, gain access to victim GPS.\n \n
