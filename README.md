<p>Ever thought that PDA and other devices is to good? Too useful? Too powerful? Yeah, probably not. The idea came to me from <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/survival-mode-remade-151">ZCP</a>, where with one of the option you can turn your PDA into a brick - but it was not funny, or, interesting. So, i decided to create something better myself. And here it is - Fatal Error.</p>

<p>Features for PDA:<br />1. Fatal Errors for different levels, eg. Red Forest, during, or, after Emission or Psi Storm - sometimes you need to reboot your PDA (M by default) to fix everything (MCM Configurable).<br />2. PDA can break from Emission, Psi Storm, Electras, Pulse and Radiation. To repair PDA, you need to go to <u>certain characters</u> or use Device Repair Kit - you can craft it on workshop. To use it, just drag it on top of a broken PDA (MCM Configurable).<br />3. You can install upgrades for any of your devices.<br />4. Your PDA screen can break after receiving physical damage. <u>Certain characters</u> can fix it, or you can use Device Repair Kit (MCM Configurable).<br />5. New PDA tiers - watch the table below to find information. If <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/milspec-pda-for-anomaly-151-152-and-gamma">Milspec PDA</a> is installed, it will replace Military PDA. Almost all new PDA 3D models were taken from <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/pda-replacer-bttr">PDA REPLACER - BTTR</a> by <a href="https://www.moddb.com/members/dar213" class="author">DAR213</a>, so, if you like them, don't forget to also support\write a good comment\rate him.<br />6. You can access PDA BIOS to tweak some settings or to fix it if something went wrong.<br />7. Ability to change PDA UI after upgrade.<br /><br /><img src="https://media.moddb.com/images/members/5/4252/4251450/profile/FEA4F129-174E-435E-BDA5-3351AEC.png" alt="" width="1577" height="258" /></p>

<p>Battery system:<br />1. Every Device now require it own battery type (AAA, AA, D or F) - see device description to find out.<br />2. Batteries can be charged\discharged by Universal Power Device (UPD) - simple drag battery or UPD on top of each other - you will quickly understand how to use it. Can be obtained by crafting or at 3 trade level. <br />3. Every battery type has a unique mAh value. For example, an F-type battery will last a very long time, but it costs a lot and is very hard to find.</p>

<p><br />Custom shaders and glitch:<br />Glitch for PDA completely remade - every PDA has its own glitch visual effect and scale. Glitch can be caused by many different things - from PDA screen damage to getting hit by electra or having a Reactor №4 amount of radiation. There is also a small amount of persistent glitch (MCM Configurable).</p>

<p>Feature for Devices:<br />1. Devices can break from Emission, Psi Storm, Electras, Pulse and Radiation. To repair them, you need to use Device Repair Kit. For now, you can't repair them at <u>certain characters</u> (to lazy to add this). Work best with <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/devices-of-anomaly-redone">DAR</a> (MCM Configurable).</p>
<p><u>Certain characters</u> - Most of the technicians. Write a comment if i missed someone.</p>
<p>Addon Parts:<br />1. Main - main part of the addon with all gameplay features.<br />2. Storyline - small quest line + unique PDA at the end.<br />3. Cumulative Patch for G.A.M.M.A. (select only if playing G.A.M.M.A. with 518 addons).<br />4. Compatibility Patches.<br />5. Fixes - various fixes for various things.</p>
<p>If you play with BaS it is best to also install this fix: <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/fatal-error-and-bas-hud-fix">link</a></p>

WARNING: Overclocking greatly increases the chance of PDA breaking and battery drain.<br />- Added a "Beeping" radius setting for the PDA in the MCM menu.<br />- Reworked compatibility patches. <br />- Added patches for <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/exo-u5">Powered Exoskeletons</a> and <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/western-goods">Western Goods</a>.<br />- Added autopatch for <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/arszis-dynamic-radiation-zones-and-radiation-overhaul">Arszi Radiation</a>.<br />- Fixed all device not breaking from radiation when the player has the "Lead Coating" upgrade for the PDA.<br />- Corrections to Russian and English localizations.<br />- Added a new quest, but since I didn&rsquo;t have time to fully polish its start, you can only begin it by modifying a certain script :) .<br />- Added a cumulative fix for G.A.M.M.A. - it works correctly only if all 518 G.A.M.M.A. mods are enabled, otherwise, manual installation of all compatibility patches is recommended (thx <a href="https://www.moddb.com/members/osterk" class="author">OsterK</a>).<br />- Rewrote the main PDA breaking script for various damage types - now it&rsquo;s 3-4 times shorter.<br />- Added a config check to determine if an item is a UPD - this allows adding UPD functions to any battery or even an artefacts (though artefacts have a minor issue).<br />- Improved the "kludge" check for which dosimeter the player has (previously triggered on ANY item movement in the player&rsquo;s inventory).<br />- Now you can't upgrade your PDA if you don't have PDA.<br />- Fixed various problems with NPC PDAs.<br />- A huge number of other changes that I can&rsquo;t remember right now since I barely wrote a changelog - I&rsquo;ll update it as I remember things.</p>
<p>26/05/2025 - 1.7.5<br />- If the player is in a No Map Location but stands on a high place, then player can access map (<a href="https://www.moddb.com/members/jasiunys" class="author">GugaRJ</a> idea).<br />- The sounds of the Geiger counter and anomaly detector are now tied not to the difficulty but to whether the player has them in their inventory.<br />-Optional trilogy anomaly detector sound.<br />- Added a new additional Geiger counter that slightly better than vanilla one.<br />- Geiger counters are now passively drain power.<br />- The anomaly detector can now be crafted (requires a <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/dynamic-anomalies-overhaul-dao-read-description-please">Dynamic Anomalies Overhaul</a> to display the distance to the anomaly).<br />- Some localization changes and improvements.<br />- Split new 3D models and icons into different folders.<br />- Added 2x1 icons for PDAs.<br />- Technicians from the Outskirts of Pripyat and Jupiter have been added to the Certain Characters List.<br />- Some other changes.<br /><br />21/05/2025 - 1.7.4.2<br />- Fix for charging detector with UPD.<br />- Fix for AAA batteries localization.<br />- Fix for incorrect localization in <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/nekomaster-mods-craftable-upgradable-af-detectors">Craftable Upgradable AF Detectors</a>.<br />- PDA Screen Damage code improvements.<br />- Increased power consumption for end-game devices, as it&rsquo;s has been almost impossible to zero power on Svarog or the Oracle NVG.<br />- Fix for crash in Warfare Mode.<br />- Fix for <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/milspec-pda-for-anomaly-151-152-and-gamma">Milspec PDA</a> ComPatch crash when disassembling some items.<br />- Fix for texture of PDA 2.0.<br /><br />19/05/2025 - 1.7.4.1<br />- Fixed crash when disassembling some items.<br /><br />18/05/2025 - 1.7.4<br />- Added a battery system (took the idea - and only the idea - from <a href="https://discord.com/invite/UScHT3Mex3">Epilogue</a>).<br />- Added a beep-beep sound for high-tier PDAs if someone is nearby (got from <a href="https://discord.com/invite/UScHT3Mex3">Epilogue</a>, thx <a href="https://www.moddb.com/members/ryan-gosling2411" class="author">Lexus2411</a>)<br />- Low-tier PDAs no longer show exact player location, direction, or companions (idea taken from <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/better-pda-progression">Better PDA Progression</a>, along with a small script to process companion icons).<br />- Fully switched to the Experimental version - the main script has been completely rewritten, reducing its size from 41K to 30K symbols, with many improvements and changes.<br />- Fixed incorrect PDA glitch processing caused by radiation.<br />- On first startup, the player&rsquo;s PDA will take some time to boot - a small immersive addition.<br />- Added a fix for traders not selling addon items (requires the latest trade_autoinject, which is part of the fix).<br />- Increased logic priority for Storyline NPCs from 1000 to 2000 (there was a strange bug caused by one of the "NPC logic improvements" addons or similar).<br />- Replaced the Kulon and 4.0 PDA icons (took from <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/cr3pis-icon-pack">Cr3pis Icons</a>).<br />- Fix for icons on DX8.<br />- Added a delay between pressing the reboot button and the actual reboot - it now looks much more immersive.<br />- Added auto-localization for damaged and broken devices - no more need to manually create localization for every damaged or broken item.<br />- Added some script failsafes.<br />- Expanded the list of maps with no map signal: Darkscape (now there&rsquo;s even less reason to visit it, even once in a playthrough), Grimwood (<a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/promzone-level">New levels</a>).<br />- Mod items added to stashes and NPC loot.<br />- Uncountable amount of other small changes and fixes. <br />- Big thanks to everyone from Anomaly and Bosspack Discord servers who helped me to test version 1.7.4 -
