		<text>The MilDEF DB6M is a PDA from American Reliance, originally manufactured for the U.S. military, which somehow found its way into the Zone. Its advantage over all other models lies in its exceptional durability and ability to withstand even the most extreme operating conditions. The device's casing is waterproof and features shock protection—the MilDEF DB6M can easily survive a direct bullet hit, take a swim in water, endure a hard fall onto concrete from a significant height, and resist wind, dust, rain, and temperature fluctuations. Additionally, the PDA is equipped with a GPS receiver, a 3.5G modem, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi modules, and a fingerprint scanner. The device is fully compliant with the FIPS 140-2 encryption standard and provides the best information protection among similar devices. This model also retains all the functions of PDA 3.1. It is the most coveted model among stalkers.\n \n

        <text>The PDA Advantech P37B is an ultra-rugged mobile computer designed for industrial, public safety, and military applications. It is built on the Marvell PXA270 processor running at 624 MHz, features a 3.7-inch transflective TFT LCD display (with a resolution of 640x480 pixels), and is equipped with 256 MB of RAM, 1 GB of built-in flash memory, and two expansion slots—microSD and CompactFlash. The device includes multiple wired and wireless interfaces, such as USB, RS-232, Ethernet (10/100 Mbps), Wi-Fi (802.11b/g), and Bluetooth. It also comes with a built-antenna GPS & GALILEO module. Additionally, a 3.5G cellular modem supporting GSM/GPRS/WCDMA/HSDPA can be installed. The PDA's sealed casing is resistant to dirt, dust, and water, meeting the IP67 protection rating. Furthermore, the P37B can withstand multiple drops from a height of 1.5 meters and vibrations in compliance with MIL-STD-810F and MIL-STD-461E standards. It is capable of operating in temperatures ranging from -20°C to +60°C. This model features the most advanced algorithm for detecting and transmitting data from other PDAs within a 300-meter radius. Unlike conventional GPS modules, the one in this PDA relies on key sets that allow direct access to network-connected devices for data retrieval. The combination of these capabilities and features makes this PDA model highly sought after among all stalkers, though only a few manage to acquire it.\n \n

		<text>An industrial-grade military model of the GETAC PS535E PDA, originally used by military engineering units and reconnaissance personnel for field operations in harsh but predictable conditions, is built with a reinforced housing and a weather-resistant display. The manufacturer of the PDA is the Taiwanese company Mitac Technology Corporation, which has long specialized in the development and production of military-grade devices. PDA GETAC PS535E can intercepts cellular and network traffic of other PDAs in order to display precise location of stalkers. The device remains reliable under normal field exposure but proves totally unfit for the Zone's environment. Its power consumption is significantly higher than most other PDAs and it can only be recharged by an UPD. Technicians never repair this model due to its complexity - and, as a result, it cannot be upgraded in any way. Rarely seen around the Zone, typically used by military personnel, or occasionally supplied by high-ranking military officials and covert operatives.\n \n

		<text>An extremely rare and unique model of the Kulon PDA, which can only be obtained on the Mainland. This model is ideal for the harsh conditions of the Zone - the PDA is made of a metal case with full electromagnetic shielding and total protection from moisture and dust, which is why its breakage is possible only in theory, and the touchscreen display is made of triplex glass, which makes it impossible to damage it, and is also covered with a special weatherproof film on which among other things, there are no traces and scratches. This model also has extremely low energy consumption, which allows it to run for up to a week on a single pair of batteries. All ports for communication with the outside world (USB, PCMCIA slot, memory card ports) are covered with special plugs, and the main focus in communication with the outside world is on wireless communication - for this purpose, a special encryption key is used that cannot be hacked and thanks to which the PDA cannot be detected - however, this entails the main disadvantage of this PDA, which is that unlike the Model 2.0 and Model 3.1 PDAs, the Kulon PDA cannot rely on encryption key sets, thereby it cannot gain direct access to network-connected devices to receive data, but, it can intercept and redirect other special encryption keys, and as a result, gain access to victim GPS.\n \n
