		<text>Found an interesting PDA here, but it's encrypted - wanna take a look?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_decypher_1">
		<text>Let me see... Hmm... The "Milspec" label doesn’t bode well... I recognize the model - it’s a GETAC. A terrible PDA for the Zone. I can’t decipher it - no idea what kind of protection system the Chinese cooked up, and I’ve never heard of anyone cracking it. So, here’s the deal: I know a way to reflash it - with complete data loss, of course - it’ll cost you 25,000 rubles since the process isn’t easy and requires... let’s say, "special" skills. Oh, and I’m also willing to buy it from you for 10,000 rubles - it’s full of high-quality components.</text>

	<string id="pda_decypher_2">
		<text>Here’s the money. \n%c[d_orange][25,000 rubles]</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_decypher_3">
		<text>Nice, perfect... Alright, plugging in my special flash drive... Rebooting... Resetting BIOS to factory defaults, wiping the memory... Booting in safe mode... All done - here you go. No idea why you need this PDA, but if it breaks - don’t even come to me for repairs.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_decypher_4">
		<text>You know what - I’ll ask about it later.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_decypher_5">
		<text>Yeah, okay then...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_decypher_6">
		<text>Take it - I don’t really need it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_decypher_7">
		<text>Smart choice! Here’s your money.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_start_1">
		<text>I have a couple of questions about the PDA...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_start_2">
		<text>What exactly do you need?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_start_3">
		<text>Well, i changed my mind...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_fix_screen_1">
		<text>My PDA screen is broken - can you replace it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_fix_screen_2">
		<text>What!? You can't break it! There's tempered glass in there, if you throw it against the wall, the brick will break! Okay, give it here... So... Well, the insides are intact, nothing serious, but replacing the screen will cost you 5,000 rubles! I can't imagine how you broke it!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_fix_screen_3">
		<text>Take the money for the screen. \n%c[d_orange][5,000 rubles]</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_fix_screen_4">
		<text>That's great, here you go, it's as good as new now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_fix_screen_5">
		<text>It's too expensive... I'll probably come back about it later..</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_fix_screen_6">
		<text>"Too expensive"!? Although, what am I surprised about - breaking tempered glass...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_fix_1">
		<text>My PDA just don't work!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_fix_2">
		<text>Give it here... Yeah, I get it - it fried out, that happens sometimes, the voltage jumps - did you get caught by emission or hit by electra? Whatever the reason, I'll need to replace almost all the electrical components. Well, you're in trouble - you'll have to shell out at least 5,000 rubles and at max 40,000 rubles - depends on PDA model. And also, don't even ask me to fix anything other than regular stalker PDAs! There was a stalker once, he brought God knows what, some kind of ultra-modern PDA, a military model - i hate such models! They're so fancy that fixing them isn't worth a second of my time.</text>

	<string id="pda_fix_6">
		<text>How much!? I think I can do without a PDA for now...</text>

	<string id="pda_fix_7">
		<text>That's great! Here you go, it should work like new now!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pda_fix_8">
		<text>Well, as you wish, but you won't last long without PDA... If you have extra money, come back.</text>

		<text>My PDA has a blue screen and I can't do anything about it.</text>

	<string id="pda_fix_bsod_5">
		<text>*Presses the reboot button, enters BIOS, then presses a few more buttons* \nAll done, fixed. And don't you dare say I didn't do anything - stupidity has its price. A sucker's not a mammoth - he won't go extinct.</text>

	<string id="st_monolitch_hackers_upgrade_descr">
		<text>In areas controlled by the Monolith, PDAs do not work and display an error - it is said that Monolith members can track active PDAs in their territory and remotely disrupt their operation. However, the Communication channel encryptor protects the PDA from this fate.</text>
